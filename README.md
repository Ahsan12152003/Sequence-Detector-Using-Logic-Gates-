# Sequence-Detector-Using-Logic-Gates-
A combinational and sequential logic-based sequence detector that identifies the 0111110 pattern and triggers an LED blink upon detection. Designed using basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, Flip-Flops), making it a cost-effective and efficient solution for digital circuit applications.
