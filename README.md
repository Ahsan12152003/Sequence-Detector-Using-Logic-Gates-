# Sequence-Detector-Using-Logic-Gates-
A combinational and sequential logic-based sequence detector that identifies the 0111110 pattern and triggers an LED blink upon detection. Designed using basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, Flip-Flops), making it a cost-effective and efficient solution for digital circuit applications.
Features:
✅ Pure logic gate design – no microcontroller required
✅ Detects the binary sequence 0111110 in a serial input stream
✅ LED blinks when the sequence is matched
✅ Efficient and real-time detection using flip-flops and combinational logic
